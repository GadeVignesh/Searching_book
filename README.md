# Searching_book
The provided Python script leverages the Google Books API to search for books based on a user's input title and display pertinent details about the first matching book. Upon execution, the script prompts the user to enter a book title and, optionally, a Google Books API key. If no API key is provided, the application utilizes the default public access. The script constructs a request to the Google Books API with the specified title and API key (if provided), sends the request, and processes the JSON response. If a matching book is found, it extracts and displays the title, authors, publisher, published date, and description. If no books are found or an error occurs, it informs the user accordingly.

This script is particularly useful for developers and users who wish to programmatically access and display book information from the extensive Google Books database. By integrating the Google Books API, the script enables seamless retrieval of book details, facilitating applications such as book search tools, inventory management systems, and educational resources. The ability to provide an API key enhances the application's reliability and access to a broader range of data, ensuring a more robust and efficient user experience.
